I originally intended for public playtesting in April, but the game won't be ready for that for a while due to an increased scope of game, and thus more development requirements.

Also finished a scene that explains the mech that was in the previous version (and still in this. When I have a chance to use a large creature like the Deathstalker, I will use it to tell a story ;)) <br>Now, I am going to work the Lucia portion of the backstory. Up to now, you have seen her briefly in Kei's prologue and Andrei's prologue. I did this intentionally so I could have an opportunity to flesh her out a little more..which I am going to do now. ;)<br>",

If you're interested in testing it, join discord here: &#8192;<a href='https://discord.gg/HYV8Zz8V2Q'>&#8193;LINK&#8192;</a>&#8193;&nbsp;Is it perfect? No. Is it bug-free? No way. But it's a valid reference point to what the demo will look like when it hits Steam. <br>&#8192;<img src='https://www.imbrane.com/assets/images/create-player-900d8cd4a131044639ed94a6001565f3.gif' class='newImg'>&#8193;<br><h4>The Latest and Greatest: What's New in the Demo?</h4><br><ul><li> <span style='font-weight:bold'>Create your player</span> feature is integrated completely. Feel free to start up the demo and create your own player.</li><li> <span style='font-weight:bold'>Match preview screen</span> got a complete overwrite. The placeholder UI is now replaced with a full overview of both players strengths and winning percentages.</li><li> <span style='font-weight:bold'>'Game crashes randomly'</span> bug fixed! (or so I hope, I can't reproduce it any more!) It seems to be related to the way async code was handled in Godot and in the newest version 4.1 I had to switch the way async code is handled and even clear out some of the async logic.</li><li> As mentioned, <span style='font-weight:bold'>game is now migrated to beta version of Godot 4.1</span>. We're running it bleeding edge as far as Godot is concerned. I'm really happy that Godot will hit stable 4.1 in the approximately same time as my game starts seeking stability too.</li><li> <span style='font-weight:bold'>A linux build!</span> I decided to have a linux build because a) people asked for it, b) I hoped it would give me more insights into some game-crashing bugs. </li><li> Numerous little bug fixes and tidy ups. I plan to write this up in a more professional manner in the future so I can list those out easily. </li></ul><br><h4>A Few Dragons Still to Slay: Current Issues</h4><br><ul><li>  <span style='font-weight:bold'>Chess AI Improvements:</span> Chess AI received a lot of comments, with some finding it too challenging and others finding it not challenging enough. This feedback isn't contradictory; it points to the inconsistencies in the AI, which I'm aware of. Over the next week (and even month), refining the AI will be a major focus of my work.</li><li> <span style='font-weight:bold'>Enhancing User Interface:</span> The user experience on the match review screen isn't the best. Navigating through a completed match should be a breeze, and I agree that there's room for improvement. I'm committed to making this experience better. Some UX issues, bugs still exist on the main match screen too. These need to be addressed.</li><li> <span style='font-weight:bold'>AI Responsiveness Issues:</span> Some of you have encountered a problem where the AI stops making moves. This was an issue I tackled in early builds, but it seems to have reappeared. It's time I dive into it and ensure it's permanently fixed.</li></ul><br><br><h5>What's next?</h5><br>As mentioned, the Demo is feature complete and all that's left is to polish it up. If I could get the AI to be decent enough in the next week and add some Quality of Life improvements then all would be ready for a Steam release of the Demo in early July.<br>I'm so excited!<br><br>",

However, we were concerned that if we added infiltration mechanics such as \"line of sight/sound\" on top of the grid turn-based system, the game would become overly complex.<br>Also, in order to emphasize the thematic feeling of exploring various abandoned buildings and searching for supplies, the battlefield size was quite large at this point. Feedback was given that moving each character one by one could potentially make the flow of the game monotonous given this map size.<br>Drawing inspiration from games such as Mutant Year Zero and Divinity: Original Sin, which have exploration phases in real-time and combat phases in turn-based mode, we experimented with a version that provides an experience similar to real-time infiltration games during regular movement, and only allows direct commands to be given to all characters during combat.<br>&#8192;<img src='https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43792072/6a84857ba304c6548fff2cf5ecbe3891b26407d9.gif' class='newImg'>&#8193;<br>&#8192;<img src='https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43792072/0abc2bec4173e32b7d7bbaa863b8e63f0447014c.gif' class='newImg'>&#8193;<br>This version got close to the desired experience generally. During the exploration phase, we were able to maintain tension by avoiding the attention of randomly moving creatures and searching for supplies. In combat, we were able to focus on tactical gameplay based on striking enemies from out of sight.<br>However, there was doubt as to whether we could achieve the desired level of quality going in this direction.<br>Making both \"real-time exploration\" and \"turn-based combat” really enjoyable differed in terms of artwork, game rules, balancing, and other aspects. We felt that if we tried to capture both aspects, there was a high possibility of ending up with mediocre results on both sides.<br>&#8192;<img src='https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43792072/bae3dedcb542cf5f40bdac46784075287ab2c5e8.gif' class='newImg'>&#8193;<br>Based on the results of the experiments, we decided to make \"integrating all intended gameplay, including movement/exploration, into a turn-based system\" the design foundation, even if there were some drawbacks. In a way, if we had just adopted the grid method by itself in the first version, we would have arrived at our current direction earlier, but we took the scenic route instead!<br>After deciding on this foundation, we fixed the overarching genre characteristics while shifting the focus of prototyping to answering the question, \"How can we incorporate elements such as line of sight/sound into a Tactics RPG?\"  We talked about this in the Dev Note about line of sight and sound.<br>In addition to this, before reaching our current state, there have been other various iterations in regard to changes in character professions, meta-game and storytelling methods, and more. If we have the chance, we may introduce these at a later date.<br> <br>Next time, we will briefly summarize how we plan to incorporate many of the suggestions you provided at Steam Next Fest 2023 going forward. See you again next week!<br>Thank you<br>",

      "contents": "<span style='font-weight:bold'>With Regards to Art & Level Direction</span><br>The game's development progress is consistent and we are currently overhauling the player's diegetic HUD to a near final state. Once overhauled, we will be ready for all new preview content for an updated store page and marketing push.<br>A lot of work has been made since the pre-alpha announcement in February. The levels are what take a lot of time, as they are relatively large and must accommodate for multiple paths which lead to different exits. Because it's an underwater game, I am trying to dispel the aversion many people might have with the concept of navigating inside of fog-obscured environments. Silhouettes play a major factor in what you're identifying, so all the levels need an art detail pass which means mostly bespoke layers upon layers of interesting geologies and recognizable landmarks within each of these large levels. <br>The ecosystem between levels is another thing that needs special attention. I'm not sure how many beasties the final game will have exactly, but the number of unique beasties spawned to make up each level's ecosystem will not be padded out by duplicate geometry with different textures applied. This means that all beasties in the game will have their own recognizable silhouettes which can be identified. So far, there are over 100 unique creatures.<br>I am also making sure the texture work for everything exists and is well made so that when you are up close to something and turn on your flashlight, you see a level of detail which many may not expect - like strata in rock or the flesh of a jelly. I say this because I do not want the fog to necessarily \"hide\" anything other than as it pertains to actual navigational gameplay and the use of HUD instruments as a result. And also secrets.<br><span style='font-weight:bold'>But What About the Gameplay</span><br>Closed alpha playtesting has been ongoing and we have made fundamental changes to the game's design and play cycle since our original inception based on this feedback. More details will be revealed as to the specifics of what the gameplay is about later - when we update the store page to give a more concise idea of what the game will actually be like to potential customers.<br><br>",

For the first draft, I'm just porting all the lines over into a Word document and then reformatting them into something more bookish.  From there, its just going to be revising and making it read like PROPER LITERATURE.  Okay, maybe not \"proper\" on the lines of Sherlock Holmes or something.  But more proper than it currently is.<br>But as I'm going through, I'm noticing a lot of lines that aren't as clear as when I first wrote the visual novel.  Which is a normal process, I've learned.  What reads great before doesn't read so well when you check on it months or years later.  But the great thing about visual novels is that you can update them much easier than you can a published book.  So while I am working on the novelization, I'm also revising the game.<br>So eventually, this game is going to get not only an eBook for DLC but it will get what I assume will be a fairly big update.  Basically revising scenes from good to better.  I'll come up with a kicky name for this update later.<br>No idea when either will release just yet, so stay tuned.  :-)<br>(Also if you haven't checked out the sequel's demo yet, its still up and its still in Next Fest.<br>&#8192;<a href='https://store.steampowered.com/app/2323650/Clash_Blue_Mirage/'>&#8193;LINK&#8192;</a>&#8193;&nbsp;So there you go, there's that.)<br>",

Did you take the inspiration from certain artists/games when it came to that? Also, what was it like working Raddland Studios and Matt Creamer?</span><br><span style='font-weight:bold'>Programancer</span>: When I first started Prison City, I kept thinking about music from games like Street Fighter 2010 and Power Blade- a mix of high octane NES goodness and catchy melodies. I have been a huge fan of Matt Creamer's work since playing Retro City Rampage and I knew from the start that he was the only person I wanted to create music for this game! Working with him has been wonderful, and he knocks it out of the park with every track!<br>&#8192;<img src='https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43163498/efbc094de4453c0983832d49f1f7d2d541ee5f39.png' class='newImg'>&#8193;<br><span style='font-weight:bold'>Question #2: Can you describe what it was like working with the testers at Retroware? What are some notable bugs you or the testers found that you're relieved to have resolved?</span><br><span style='font-weight:bold'>Programancer</span>: They're the essential front lines of the bug war! It is so easy for bugs to slip through the cracks that developers would never find- we get so used to our games that we go through the motions as if it's just second nature- we can set out to test every possible thing those changes may have affected. The testers have been really awesome to work with and they've found things I absolutely never would have found on my own- and honestly, it's a huge relief every time a bug is found because it gives me an opportunity to dive into things I probably haven't touched in a while and fix them up- or in some cases make things better than they were before<br>&#8192;<img src='https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43163498/85aec7b4c20c7e348c79ee198e7071757b9a2b7e.png' class='newImg'>&#8193;<br>As for a bug that I'm most relieved to have resolved is one where a certain NPC just idles on screen having a smoke after you're supposed to respawn from dying. While it was enjoyable to see that NPC have a nice relaxing break, it wasn't a whole lot of fun for the player!<br>Of course, there are some bugs I try to keep in, however, if they're helpful for speedrunners--and can only be triggered with a deliberate attempt--but that one just wasn't cutting it.<br>&#8192;<img src='https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43163498/8e1f8d1b1f65fa824bd4de399ebfb00b98682f6b.png' class='newImg'>&#8193;<br><span style='font-weight:bold'>Question #3: Why did you decide to go with a chakram as the primary weapon for Hal? Did you consider other weapons prior to deciding on the chakram? Also, can you describe what it was like getting the chakram to work as desired/as in its current state in the game?</span><br><span style='font-weight:bold'>Programancer</span>: The chakram was actually one of the first things I coded, and honestly I didn't have much time to consider another type of weapon when I started developing Prison City-<br>I knew that I didn't want to go with a gun and instead wanted to go a gun and instead wanted to go with something with a little more subtle nuance that didn't have unlimited range but could still be utilized in 8 directions. I've always been a big fan of Power Blade's boomerang, but I didn't want to go quite as far in that direction either- I did like the idea of a returning weapon though. I ended up looking to Xena for inspiration- Xena had a chakram and Xena is cool! The thing where the chakram returns to you with a different arc depending on which direction you're facing was inspired by Link's Awakening- where Link will swing his sword from different angles depending on what direction you're facing.<br>&#8192;<img src='https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43163498/ccf146dbd4609f43a065075d37a7a55c660bb551.png' class='newImg'>&#8193;<br>&#8192;<img src='https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43163498/8f8e709991086bf18f23741d55bb3bf837a44c83.png' class='newImg'>&#8193;<br>With all of that in, I knew the game would have to be designed almost entirely around the player's moveset and weapons, so I made sure there were some beneficial quirks to it- like for example: even though the chakram returns to the player after hitting a wall, it will still push through slightly so you can damage enemies or crates that are next to the wall it's hitting. In some cases, enemies will be positioned perfectly around the player, and if the player holds the attack button when throwing a chakram, it'll hang out in front of them for a while, and they can move it around them briefly. This was inspired by Castlevania 4's whipping mechanics!<br>&#8192;<img src='https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/43163498/6e8ea13970a147e65405b5109a5e0b67df8aa26f.png' class='newImg'>&#8193;<br>That's all we've got this time!

Endlich gibt es das Game hier auf Steam für knapp 5 Euro. <br>Ja ja, ich weiß, was ihr denkt: 5 Euro, das sind 10 Mark, das sind 20 Ostmark, das sind 100 Ostmark auf dem Schwarzmarkt … Aber schaut euch einfach mal die Rezensionen an und wieviel Spielzeit die Leude da so abgerissen haben; das ist doch verdammt viel Känguru-Spaß für nen schmalen Taler. Wer ab und zu mal in unseren Discord reinschaut, weiß auch, dass das Game leider bisher nicht gerade die Kasse zum Klingeln gebracht hat - im Gegenteil hat es noch nicht mal die Mindestsumme erreicht, die man auf Steam umsetzen muss, damit das Spiel Trading Cards und Community-Gegenstände haben darf. Erkennt man übrigens an dem mysteriösen Hinweis \"Profilfunktionen eingeschränkt\" rechts in der Feature-Liste auf der Steamseite. <br>Dabei könnte es so einfach sein: Wenn alle, die das Game auf der Wishlist haben, es jetzt kaufen würden, dann hätten wir die Summe ruckzuck erreicht. Und mal ehrlich: Wer hätte nicht gerne digitale Sammelkarten vom Känguru, Marc-Uwe, Krapotke, Herta und den ganzen anderen Haudegen? Und dazu schnuckelige Hintergründe, Rahmen, animierte Profilbilder und Badges mit den besten Rängen eines gewissen hierarchiefreien Geheimbunds?!?<br>Also macht es wie die vom Boxclub und … schlagt zu! <br>Die erste und zweite Regel des Boxclubs gilt hingegen nicht; falls ihr das Game selbst schon habt, dann redet unbedingt ständig und ganz viel darüber. Quatscht das Ding den Leuten auf, zwingt sie zum antiterroristischen Glück - Lasst die Theorie zur Praxis werden und bringt das Kapital zurück in die Hände der hart ackernden Arbeiterklasse … und damit meine ich UNS hier bei<br>TUNERMAXX ːDottieJoyː<br>",
